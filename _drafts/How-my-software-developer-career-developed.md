title: How my software development career developed

<p class="post-excerpt">
    Overview of how my career as a software developer evolved from my junior year at college to the point where I'm currently at after about 7 years.

It seems like a good idea to use my first blog post to describe my path to full stack web engineer career I'm specialized in today. I hope the journey would inspire some of you deciding about your career or motivate some peeps to commit to learning a new tech stack in order to land a position they dream about.

My engineering career started when I began my studies at Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana in 2006. I've built some Wordpress sites in the past, but when I stepped into collage I knew almost nothing about programming. Luckily my solid math foundation from high school proved to be very useful when learning software development and so I quickly managed to get the hang of programming and follow along the course of study.

I started my third/ last year of studies without actually knowing what field to choose to specialize in. Every subject I found interesting after I worked on it for some time. Web development seemed like a field that would see some serious growth in the years to come, so I choose it as my preferred career path.

A class in the first semester of the third year was about developing a project from start to finish. My team choose to build a web app to make learning history in primary school a more interesting thing to do. We did a great job and so I got a recommendation from (nosilec predmeta) for (praksa) we had planned in the next semester.

Whit the recommendation I landed a paid (praksa) in a company developing access control systems. The company offered me a job after 10 weeks of (praksa) have passed. This was my first position as a web developer. I've customized our ticket selling platform to suit more than 25 different designs from our customers. In doing so I learned a lot about CSS and HTML.

TODO:
Application to work at Outfit7 - 10 days of learning AngularJS as a mad man. Didn't get the job at last, but my determination to improve as a web developer stuck with me and I decided I should dive deeply into web development.

I started learning JavaScript. I knew how to program because of my years in college, but I decided to learn all the quirks and design choices of JavaScript. I wanted to be able to call myself a front-end developer and learning JavaScript seemed how I would get there. Deepening my knowledge of CSS and HTML wouldn't hurt, too.

I created a plan, read a bunch of books about JavaScript and watched many video tutorials. I subscribed to RSS feeds of a lot of front-end related websites and was reading their articles on my commute almost all the time. I was eagerly absorbing all the information about the technologies. I also tried to apply as many new things I learned to my projects at work.

The more I learned, the more confident I was as a front-end engineer. When I collected enough of this confidence to change my LinkedIn headline to call myself a front-end engineer, many job offers started to appear in my inbox. Most of them were from companies from other countries and since I didn't want to move, I had to turn them down. But one day I got an email from Zemanta's tech lead.

I got invited to the interview. 4 hours of interviews, I was scared, but at the end I was surprised how much I know about software development. It seems interviewers at Zemanta have thought the same and they offered me a junior position I gladly accepted.

I kept improving as a front-end engineer for the first year (Angular JS, front-end architecture etc.) at Zemanta. After a while though I started to notice that I read less and less of articles from my RSS feed. But not because I was becoming lazy, but because I knew that stuff. At the beginning everything was interesting to read about and learn. However the more you learn, the less new you can learn from articles filling your RSS feed.

And I was thankful for that. For the longest time I was worried I wouldn't be able to keep up with such rapid development of new front-end technologies for the rest of my life. I was scared JavaScript fatigue would cause me to burn out and fail at my career as a web developer. However, now that I established a solid base of front-end knowhow, I know this most likely won't be the case. In fact, I feel I learned enough front-end development to be able to pick up new framework/ technology and be productive in it in a few days/ weeks.

In order to progress further in my engineering career I had to adjust my learning course. I wanted to expand my knowledge of web development from front-end to back-end too.

TODO:
Django, python, REST APIs, Zemanta's support. To become more well-rounded engineer - project research, development, and support.
