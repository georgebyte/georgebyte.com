title: How my software development career developed 
---

<p class="post-excerpt">
    It all started with Age of Empires II. Then Wordpress made me enroll in a computer science program at university.

## Chapter 1: Pre-university years
My family got our first PC when I was about eight years old. Truth be told, I used it mainly for gaming. You know, AOE II and stuff. I've shown absolutely no interest in software development until I was fourteen or so.

Around the age of fourteen I started to use the web more frequently. I remember being quite amazed by the websites of that era. They sparked an interest in me. I wanted to create my own website!

But my initial motivation quickly faced an obstacle. I literally didn't know where to start. HTML, CSS, PHP, web hosting, domain names etc. are some of the terms that kept me up at night. Well, not really, I just gave up because there was just too much to learn to get started.

Luckily quitting wasn't that easy after all. There were all these amazing websites being developed that were constantly reminding me of my wish to create a website. So I gave it another try.

This time around I came across Wordpress. A pre-made website with simple install instruction. It was magical. It was all I needed. And I had my first website up and running in a week.

Many other hobby websites followed the first one. I was slowly learning web technologies like HTML and PHP by poking around Wordpress code. It wasn't too hard to do, but it felt like real programming. I liked the feeling. I liked it enough to let it influence my decision about what career path to pursuit once I'm done with high school. And so I decided to enroll in a computer science program at Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana.

## Chapter 2: Engineering studies
When I started my studies in 2006 I knew almost nothing about programming. Luckily my solid math foundation from high school proved to be very useful when learning software development and I managed to get the hang of programming rather quickly.

I started my third/ last year of studies without actually knowing what field to choose to specialize in. Every subject I found interesting after I worked on it for some time. Web development seemed like a field that would see some serious growth in the years to come, so I choose it as my preferred career path.

A class in the first semester of the third year was about developing a project from start to finish. My team choose to build a web app to make learning history in primary school a more interesting thing to do. We did a great job and so I got a recommendation from (nosilec predmeta) for (praksa) we had planned in the next semester.


## Chapter 3: Student internships
Whit the recommendation I landed a paid (praksa) in a company developing access control systems. The company offered me a job after 10 weeks of (praksa) have passed. This was my first position as a web developer. I've customized our ticket selling platform to suit more than 25 different designs from our customers. In doing so I learned a lot about CSS and HTML.

Student internship at Celtra.

## Chapter 4: My first real job application
TODO:
Application to work at Outfit7 - 10 days of learning AngularJS as a mad man. Didn't get the job at last, but my determination to improve as a web developer stuck with me and I decided I should dive deeply into web development.

## Chapter 5: JavaScript madness
I started learning JavaScript. I knew how to program because of my years in college, but I decided to learn all the quirks and design choices of JavaScript. I wanted to be able to call myself a front-end developer and learning JavaScript seemed how I would get there. Deepening my knowledge of CSS and HTML wouldn't hurt, too.

I created a plan, read a bunch of books about JavaScript and watched many video tutorials. I subscribed to RSS feeds of a lot of front-end related websites and was reading their articles on my commute almost all the time. I was eagerly absorbing all the information about the technologies. I also tried to apply as many new things I learned to my projects at work.

## Chapter 6: LinkedIn works (at least it did work for me)
The more I learned, the more confident I was as a front-end engineer. When I collected enough of this confidence to change my LinkedIn headline to call myself a front-end engineer, many job offers started to appear in my inbox. Most of them were from companies from other countries and since I didn't want to move, I had to turn them down. But one day I got an email from Zemanta's tech lead.

## Chapter 7: Zemanta
TODO: A few words about Zemanta
I got invited to the interview. 4 hours of interviews, I was scared, but at the end I was surprised how much I know about software development. It seems interviewers at Zemanta have thought the same and they offered me a junior position I gladly accepted.

I kept improving as a front-end engineer for the first year (Angular JS, front-end architecture etc.) at Zemanta. After a while though I started to notice that I read less and less of articles from my RSS feed. But not because I was becoming lazy, but because I knew that stuff. At the beginning everything was interesting to read about and learn. However the more you learn, the less new you can learn from articles filling your RSS feed.

And I was thankful for that. For the longest time I was worried I wouldn't be able to keep up with such rapid development of new front-end technologies for the rest of my life. I was scared JavaScript fatigue would cause me to burn out and fail at my career as a web developer. However, now that I established a solid base of front-end knowhow, I know this most likely won't be the case. In fact, I feel I learned enough front-end development to be able to pick up new framework/ technology and be productive in it in a few days/ weeks.

## Chater 8: Conclusion (not really)
In order to progress further in my engineering career I had to adjust my learning course. I wanted to expand my knowledge of web development from front-end to back-end too.

TODO:
Django, python, REST APIs, Zemanta's support. To become more well-rounded engineer - project research, development, and support.

**Keep calm and keep on learning.**
