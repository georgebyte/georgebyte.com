## Keep in mind 

* <mark>Write to satisfy yourself</mark> first and foremost. If others read it and benefit from it that's a welcome side effect. If you worry about who is reading, why they're reading, or if anyone is even reading at all, you'd be too paralyzed to write.[^1][^2]
* Writing is the best way to find out whether your thoughts make sense or are merely gut feelings.[^2]
* Good writers aren't much smarter then other people. Theyâ€™ve just forced themselves through the process of transferring vague feelings into words. This process generates clarity and "intelligence".[^2]
