## Keep in mind 

* You don't get paid to program, <mark>you get paid to ship software that people will actually want to use</mark>.[^1]

## Use a library or implement something yourself?

* Reinvent the wheel, because it's one of the best ways to learn. But only after you researched every already created wheel that you can find.[^1]

## Dealing with bugs

* Some bugs don't matter. It is better to fix the bugs that are problematic in practice (<mark>exception driven development</mark>) rather than theory.[^1]
    * [?] Rare bugs should probably still be fixed if reported.
